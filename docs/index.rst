HammerBlade IR
==============

HBIR is a low-level programming language and compiler target for the
HammerBlade reconfigurable manycore processor.
Is core principle is *general abstraction for specialized machines:*
HBIR itself makes very few assumptions about the hardware and instead offers a
general substrate that can express a wide range of hardware configurations.
An HBIR program jointly specifies the software algorithm itself, the
configuration it runs on, and the physical hardware it targets.
