HammerBlade IR
==============

HBIR is an intermediate representation / DSL for the
HammerBlade Project that expresses the static and dynamic configuration
of the target hardware as well as the high-level algorithm to be run.
HBIR programs specify the hardware parameters of the target and how an
algorithm should use the hardware.
